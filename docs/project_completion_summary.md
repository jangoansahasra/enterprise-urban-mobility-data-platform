# Project Completion Summary

## Project Name

Enterprise Urban Mobility Data Platform

## Summary

The Enterprise Urban Mobility Data Platform is an end-to-end data engineering, analytics, API, and machine learning project built with NYC Yellow Taxi trip data.

The platform ingests raw TLC taxi trip files, profiles and validates the data, transforms raw records into analytics-ready datasets, loads cleaned data into PostgreSQL, creates SQL analytics views, exposes metrics through FastAPI, and trains machine learning models for taxi trip duration prediction.

## Business Problem

City transportation agencies receive large volumes of trip records every month, but raw operational files are not immediately useful for decision-making.

This project solves that problem by turning raw taxi data into trusted datasets that can support:

- demand analysis
- revenue analysis
- borough and zone performance
- payment behavior analysis
- API-based analytics access
- machine learning trip duration prediction
- future Power BI dashboards

Known data quality notes:

```text
missing passenger count: 1,768,022 rows
missing passenger count percentage: 16.98%

fares over $500: 89
```

These are documented as source-data quality notes and outliers rather than hidden or silently removed.

## Key Technical Decisions

### Preserve Raw Data

Raw input files are kept unchanged. Cleaned outputs are saved separately.

### Separate Profiling, Validation, and Transformation

Profiling describes the raw data, validation reports quality issues, and transformation creates cleaned analytics-ready data.

### Use PostgreSQL Fact and Dimension Modeling

The database uses `fact_trips` for trip-level facts and dimension tables for vendor, payment, and location reference data.

### Use SQL Views for Analytics

SQL views provide a reusable business logic layer for API endpoints, BI dashboards, and machine learning features.

### Build Two ML Models

The analytical model includes fare and total amount fields and performs strongly.

The pre-trip model excludes post-trip financial fields and is more realistic for operational prediction.

### Keep Tests Lightweight

Automated tests avoid requiring the full database or raw dataset so they can run quickly in local environments.

## Portfolio Summary

Enterprise Urban Mobility Data Platform | Python, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, Docker, Power BI

- Built an end-to-end data engineering platform that ingested 3 months of NYC Yellow Taxi trip records, profiled and validated raw data quality, transformed over 10 million records, and loaded analytics-ready tables into PostgreSQL.
- Designed a fact and dimension database model with SQL analytics views for daily trip trends, hourly demand, borough revenue, zone performance, payment summaries, and ML-ready feature generation.
- Developed FastAPI endpoints for analytics and trip duration prediction, including both analytical and pre-trip machine learning prediction workflows.
- Trained Random Forest regression models for taxi trip duration prediction, achieving 1.35-minute MAE for the analytical model and 3.18-minute MAE for the pre-trip model.
